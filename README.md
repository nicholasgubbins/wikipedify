Wikipedify
==========

Get information from Wikipedia wherever you go on the Web. A simple Chrome extension to get the first paragraph from Wikipedia based on any highlighted text. 

Soon to be available on the Chrome store.

Special thanks to [rbilgil's hoverpedia](https://github.com/rbilgil/hoverpedia) for the skeleton of the project, as well as [fgnass' spin.js](https://github.com/fgnass/spin.js/).


###Features:
- highlight any amount of text and get the key info from Wikipedia
- dynamically moving hoverbox to fit on the screen
- includes a link to the Wikipedia page

###To Do:
- some pages have erratic empty paragraphs at the beginning, or a non-formalised way of saying there are multiple possible pages. Catch these as they are found and optimise for these instances.
- add an on/off switch into the browser toolbar
- fix up the box-size when there is just one line of text
- place the box at the best location so that no text is covered/the box appears pointing to the middle of the highlighted area
- allow for all links in the first para to appear
